# ZX Spectrum +4

A modern-day ZX Spectrum OS rewritten from scratch in ARM assembly (aarch64) to
run natively on RPi +3B.

If you are not familiar with the ZX Spectrum computer from the 1980's, there
are some excellent emulators around, such as [Retro Virtual
Machine](http://www.retrovirtualmachine.org/), and even some very good online
emulators that you can run directly in your browser.

For more information about the history and development of this project, see
