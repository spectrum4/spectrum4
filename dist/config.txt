#
# GPU memory in megabytes, sets the memory split between the CPU and GPU; the
# CPU gets the remaining memory. The minimum value is 16; the maximum value is
# 192, 448, or 944, depending on whether you are using a 256MB, 512MB, or
# 1024MB Pi. The default value is 64. For the Raspberry Pi 4, which is
# available in 1GB, 2GB and 4GB versions, the minimum and maximum value are the
# same as for a 1GB device.
#
# Setting gpu_mem to low values may automatically disable certain firmware
# features, as there are some things the GPU cannot do if it has access to too
# little memory. So if a feature you are trying to use isn't working, try
# setting a larger GPU memory split.
