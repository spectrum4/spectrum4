# These tests are very similar to the po_t_udg tests, with one major difference:
# IY is a non-standard value in these tests (0x5000 instead of 0x5c3a).



# This test prints char 0xfd (BASIC keyword "CLEAR") to printer with bit 0 of
# [FLAGS] set to 0 (leading space _not_ suppressed) using a mock print-out
# routine that doesn't disturb any registers. Expected output is " CLEAR ".
