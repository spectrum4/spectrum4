.gitignore
# Specify main.go explicitly so that go build doesn't call `git status
# --porcelain` which would read all files in repository, so that if any file is
# updated, the whole DAG underneath this `go build` would run again.
# Note, we could have alternatively called `go build` with `-buildvcs=false`
# but then .gitignore file is read, and also this Tupfile, so changing a
# comment here would cause a rebuild, so for now using main.go is the better
# solution to avoid the unnecessary file scanning of the go build system.
